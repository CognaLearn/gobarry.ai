                </li>
                <li>
                    Examples of personal data you may provide to us include (depending on

            </ol>

                2. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA
            </h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Generally, we collect personal data in the following ways:
                    <br /> a) when
                    you submit any forms to us;
                    <br /> b) when
                    you enter into any agreement or provide other documentation or information in respect of your
                    interactions with us, or when you use our Services;

                    you interact with our staff;
                    <br />d) when
                    you interact with us via our Websites;
                    <br />e) when
                    you request that we contact you or request that you be included in an email or other mailing
                    list;
                    <br />f) when
                    you respond to our promotions, initiatives or to any request for additional Personal Data;
                    <br />g)
                    when
                    you submit your personal data to us for any other reasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you provide us with any personal data relating to a third party
                    (e.g. information of your spouse, children, parents, and/or employees), by submitting such
                    information
                    to us, you represent to us that you have obtained the consent of the third party to provide us with
                    their personal data for the respective purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should ensure that all personal data submitted to us is complete,
                    accurate, true and correct. Failure on your part to do so may result
                    in our inability to provide you with the requested Services or
                    delays in providing you with Services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generally speaking when you use our Services, we will collect non-
                    personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers andservers
                    typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the
                    date and
                    time of each visitor and User request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
                    information is
                    to better understand how our visitors and Users use our Services. From time to time, we may release
                    non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
                    the usage
                    of its website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition, we may also collect aggregated statistics about the behaviour
                    of visitors and Users. We may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, we
                    do not
                    disclose personal data other than as described below
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>3. AMOUNT OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The amount and type of personal data which we collect from you will
                    depend on the nature of the interaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In each case, we will collect such personal data only insofar as is
                    necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purposes set out in this Privacy<br>Policy or
                    which we may otherwise notify to you from time to time. You can always refuse to supply us with the
                    requested personal data, with the caveat that such refusal may prevent you from enjoying certain
